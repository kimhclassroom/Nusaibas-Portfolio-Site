# Hi, I'm Nusaiba Hameed
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I‚Äôll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## About me
- I enjoy reading, photography, and writing
- In the future I hope to study Neuroscience
- I am taking Computer Science because I believe an understanding of programming languages and logic structures also helps in understanding the human brain
- I have experience using Python and Java

## Project Reflections
- üîß Project 1: *Dolphin Dash - this project was a game where the player had to use the arrow keys to manouver the dolphin through an obstacle course. They could collect powerups or encounter challenges along the way*
- üß† Concept I learned: *I gained a better understanding of the logic structure of various loops for this project. I had to coordinate many loops and involve arrays in order to manage the different components moving across the screen. In the end, I was unable to get a few final components of the game woking due to logic errors in my loops. Though feedback, I was able to identify those errors, allowing me to avoid making them again in the future.*
