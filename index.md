# Hi, I'm Nusaiba Hameed
Welcome to my ICS4U portfolio. I’ll use this site to post my work and reflections.

## Highlights
- 🔧 Project 1: *Dolphin Dash - this project was a game where the player had to use the arrow keys to manouver the dolphin through an obstacle course. They could collect powerups or encounter challenges along the way*
- 🧠 Concept I learned: *I gained a better understanding of the logic structure of various loops for this project. I had to coordinate many loops and involve arrays in order to manage the different components moving across the screen. In the end, I was unable to get a few final components of the game woking due to logic errors in my loops. Though feedback, I was able to identify those errors, allowing me to avoid making them again in the future.*
